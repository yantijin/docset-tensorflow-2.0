<p>variable_creator is expected to be a function with the following signature:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="err">  def variable_creator(next_creator, **kwargs)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The creator is supposed to eventually call the next_creator to create a
variable if it does want to create a variable and not call Variable or
ResourceVariable directly. This helps make creators composable. A creator may
choose to create multiple variables, return already existing variables, or
simply register that a variable was created and defer to the next creators in
line. Creators can also modify the keyword arguments seen by the next
creators.</p>
<p>Custom getters in the variable scope will eventually resolve down to these
custom creators when they do create variables.</p>
<p>The valid keyword arguments in kwds are:
    initial_value: A <code>Tensor</code>, or Python object convertible to a <code>Tensor</code>,
      which is the initial value for the Variable. The initial value must have
      a shape specified unless <code>validate_shape</code> is set to False. Can also be a
      callable with no argument that returns the initial value when called. In
      that case, <code>dtype</code> must be specified. (Note that initializer functions
      from init_ops.py must first be bound to a shape before being used here.)
    trainable: If <code>True</code>, the default, also adds the variable to the graph
      collection <code>GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES</code>. This collection is used as
      the default list of variables to use by the <code>Optimizer</code> classes.
      <code>trainable</code> defaults to <code>True</code>, unless <code>synchronization</code> is
      set to <code>ON_READ</code>, in which case it defaults to <code>False</code>.
    collections: List of graph collections keys. The new variable is added to
      these collections. Defaults to <code>[GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES]</code>.
    validate_shape: If <code>False</code>, allows the variable to be initialized with a
      value of unknown shape. If <code>True</code>, the default, the shape of
      <code>initial_value</code> must be known.
    caching_device: Optional device string describing where the Variable
      should be cached for reading.  Defaults to the Variable's device.
      If not <code>None</code>, caches on another device.  Typical use is to cache
      on the device where the Ops using the Variable reside, to deduplicate
      copying through <code>Switch</code> and other conditional statements.
    name: Optional name for the variable. Defaults to <code>'Variable'</code> and gets
      uniquified automatically.
    dtype: If set, initial_value will be converted to the given type.
      If <code>None</code>, either the datatype will be kept (if <code>initial_value</code> is
      a Tensor), or <code>convert_to_tensor</code> will decide.
    constraint: A constraint function to be applied to the variable after
      updates by some algorithms.
    use_resource: if True, a ResourceVariable is always created.
    synchronization: Indicates when a distributed a variable will be
      aggregated. Accepted values are constants defined in the class
      <a href="../../../tf/VariableSynchronization.html"><code>tf.VariableSynchronization</code></a>. By default the synchronization is set to
      <code>AUTO</code> and the current <code>DistributionStrategy</code> chooses
      when to synchronize.
    aggregation: Indicates how a distributed variable will be aggregated.
      Accepted values are constants defined in the class
      <a href="../../../tf/VariableAggregation.html"><code>tf.VariableAggregation</code></a>.</p>
<p>This set may grow over time, so it's important the signature of creators is as
mentioned above.</p>
