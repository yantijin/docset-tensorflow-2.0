<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

<p>There is often a need to lift variable initialization ops out of control-flow
scopes, function-building graphs, and gradient tapes. Entering an
<code>init_scope</code> is a mechanism for satisfying these desiderata. In particular,
entering an <code>init_scope</code> has three effects:</p>
<p>(1) All control dependencies are cleared the moment the scope is entered;
      this is equivalent to entering the context manager returned from
      <code>control_dependencies(None)</code>, which has the side-effect of exiting
      control-flow scopes like <a href="../tf/cond.html"><code>tf.cond</code></a> and <a href="../tf/while_loop.html"><code>tf.while_loop</code></a>.</p>
<p>(2) All operations that are created while the scope is active are lifted
      into the lowest context on the <code>context_stack</code> that is not building a
      graph function. Here, a context is defined as either a graph or an eager
      context. Every context switch, i.e., every installation of a graph as
      the default graph and every switch into eager mode, is logged in a
      thread-local stack called <code>context_switches</code>; the log entry for a
      context switch is popped from the stack when the context is exited.
      Entering an <code>init_scope</code> is equivalent to crawling up
      <code>context_switches</code>, finding the first context that is not building a
      graph function, and entering it. A caveat is that if graph mode is
      enabled but the default graph stack is empty, then entering an
      <code>init_scope</code> will simply install a fresh graph as the default one.</p>
<p>(3) The gradient tape is paused while the scope is active.</p>
<p>When eager execution is enabled, code inside an init_scope block runs with
eager execution enabled even when defining graph functions via
tf.contrib.eager.defun. For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">tf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">compat</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">v1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">enable_eager_execution</span><span class="p">()</span>
