<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->


<p>This method works similar to tf.map_fn but is optimized to run much faster,
possibly with a much larger memory footprint. The speedups are obtained by
vectorization (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04243.pdf). The idea behind
vectorization is to semantically launch all the invocations of <code>fn</code> in
parallel and fuse corresponding operations across all these invocations. This
fusion is done statically at graph generation time and the generated code is
often similar in performance to a manually fused version.</p>

<p>Because <a href="../tf/vectorized_map.html"><code>tf.vectorized_map</code></a> fully parallelizes the batch, this method will
generally be significantly faster than using <a href="../tf/map_fn.html"><code>tf.map_fn</code></a>, especially in eager
mode. However this is an experimental feature and currently has a lot of
limitations:
  - There should be no data dependency between the different semantic
    invocations of <code>fn</code>, i.e. it should be safe to map the elements of the
    inputs in any order.
  - Stateful kernels may mostly not be supported since these often imply a
    data dependency. We do support a limited set of such stateful kernels
    though (like RandomFoo, Variable operations like reads, etc).
  - <code>fn</code> has limited support for control flow operations. <a href="../tf/cond.html"><code>tf.cond</code></a> in
    particular is not supported.
  - <code>fn</code> should return nested structure of Tensors or Operations. However
    if an Operation is returned, it should have zero outputs.
  - The shape and dtype of any intermediate or output tensors in the
    computation of <code>fn</code> should not depend on the input to <code>fn</code>.</p>

<h4>Args:</h4>

<ul>
<li><b><code>fn</code></b>: The callable to be performed. It accepts one argument, which will have
the same (possibly nested) structure as <code>elems</code>, and returns a possibly
nested structure of Tensors and Operations, which may be different than
the structure of <code>elems</code>.</li>
<li><b><code>elems</code></b>: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which will
be unpacked along their first dimension. The nested sequence of the
resulting slices will be mapped over by <code>fn</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Returns:</h4>

<p>A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors. Each tensor packs the
results of applying fn to tensors unpacked from elems along the first
dimension, from first to last.</p>

<h4>Examples:</h4>

<p>```python
def outer_product(a):
  return tf.tensordot(a, a, 0)</p>

<p>batch_size = 100
a = tf.ones((batch_size, 32, 32))
c = tf.vectorized_map(outer_product, a)
assert c.shape == (batch_size, 32, 32, 32, 32)
```</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Computing per-example gradients</h1>

<p>batch_size = 10
num_features = 32
layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)</p>

<p>def model_fn(arg):
  with tf.GradientTape() as g:
    inp, label = arg
    inp = tf.expand_dims(inp, 0)
    label = tf.expand_dims(label, 0)
    prediction = layer(inp)
    loss = tf.nn.l2_loss(label - prediction)
  return g.gradient(loss, (layer.kernel, layer.bias))</p>

<p>inputs = tf.random_uniform([batch_size, num_features])
labels = tf.random_uniform([batch_size, 1])
per_example_gradients = tf.vectorized_map(model_fn, (inputs, labels))
assert per_example_gradients[0].shape == (batch_size, num_features, 1)
assert per_example_gradients[1].shape == (batch_size, 1)
```</p>
